# jemalloc-experiments
Performance testing or system benchmarks for jemalloc

This repository contains programs that are useful in jemalloc development, but
not portable or polished enough to live in the main repo. Here we have some
relaxed constraints on languages, dependencies, and the build environment.

Libraries that need to be installed:
  - gflags
